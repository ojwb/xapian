	 * We workaround this to support older years by calling mktime() for a

	 * highest year Microsoft's mktime() handles, and also before 2038 for
	 * 32-bit time_t), and such that the leap year pattern matches.  For
	 * 32-bit time_t we just need to add a multiple of 4, but for 64-bit
	 * time_t we need to add a multiple of 400.
	 *
	 * We require the year to be >= 1901 for 32-bit time_t since the
	 * oldest representable date in signed 32-bit time_t is in 1901
	 * so there's no point retrying anything older:
	 *
	 *   Fri 13 Dec 1901 20:45:52 UTC
	 *
	 * For larger time_t we support any tm_year value which fits in an int.
	 * This is somewhat dubious before the adoption of the Gregorian
	 * calendar but it matches what most mktime() implementations seem to
	 * do.
