 *  @param cmd		The command to run.
 *  @param use_shell	If false, try to avoid using a shell to run the command.
 *  @param out		Pointer to std::string to put stdout in or NULL to
 *			discard stdout.  (default: NULL)
 *  @param alt_status	Exit status to treat as success in addition to 0
 *			(default: Only treat exit status 0 as success).
 *
 *  Note: use_shell=false mode makes some assumptions about the command:
 *
 *  * only single quotes are used (double quotes and backslash quoting are
 *    not currently handled, aside from in the four character sequence '\''
 *    within single quotes).
 *  * the following redirections are supported, but they must be unquoted and
 *    appear exactly as shown, and each be a separate word in the command:
 *    >/dev/null 2>/dev/null 2>&1 1>&2
 *  * environment variables set before the command are handled correctly,
 *    for example: LANG=C some-command
 *
 *  The command_needs_shell() function above can be used to check a command,
 *  but is somewhat more conservative than what this function actually
 *  supports.
 *
 *  Currently the shell is only actually avoided for systems with both fork()
 *  and socketpair().  Other systems will ignore use_shell and always use the
 *  same code path (which may or may not involve some analog of the Unix
 *  shell).
